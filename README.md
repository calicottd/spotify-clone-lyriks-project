# spotify-clone-lyriks-project
My first react project! I learned a lot.

I wanted to practice my javascript skills while also learning react in a way that I could relate to: music! 
In this project I used javascript, html, css, tailwind, redux toolkit, rapidApi and of course react! 

Currently I am working to resolve an issue with the Shazam Core API as Artist Details V1 has been deprecated so I am not able
to get the artist details from Shazam.
